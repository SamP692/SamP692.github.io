        <h3>Home, Sweet Home</h3>
        <p>I’m addicted to this fantastic city. I’ve spent almost my entirely life in New York and I’m as much of a townie as a big city can have. I imagine the great journey of life will see me venture off to many corners of the earth but when it’s time to rise up against Cyberdyne Systems you can be sure to find me in the greatest city on the planet.</p>

        <h3>Developer, color: green;</h3>
        <p>I’ve recently embarked on a new journey, completing General Assembly’s immersive web development course. I’ve worked almost exclusively in sales and marketing since leaving college but decided it was time to follow my dream to work with code. I absolutely love it and have a million projects going on at any time. Stay tuned for more silly Sam Peterson web applications.</p>

        <h3>Numbers and Magic</h3>
        <p>Sports—namely baseball and soccer—are a lifelong obsession of mine. A huge part of this passion comes from the stories and mysterious patterns that the numbers of a game can tell you. Conversely, the inexplicable nature of sports, and the endless behaviors that numbers fail to explain time and time again contribute to just as much of the intrigue for me.</p>
