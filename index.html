        <h3>Home, Sweet Home</h3>
        <p>I’m addicted to this city. I’ve spent my entirely life in New York and I’m as much of a townie as a big city can have. I imagine the serpentine journey of life will see me venture off to many corners of the earth but, when it’s time to rise up against Cyberdyne Systems, you can be sure to find me in the greatest city on the planet.</p>

        <h3>Developer, color: green;</h3>
        <p>I’ve recently embarked on a new journey, completing General Assembly’s immersive web development course. I’ve worked almost exclusively in sales and marketing since graduating college, but decided it was time to pursue my coding aspirations. I love the work and have a million projects going on at any time. Stay tuned for more whimsical Sam Peterson web apps.</p>

        <h3>Numbers and Magic</h3>
        <p>Sports—namely baseball and soccer—are a lifelong obsession of mine. A large part of this passion comes from the stories and enigmatic patterns that the numbers of a game can reveal. Conversely, the inexplicable nature of sports, and the numerous behaviors that statistics fail to explain time and again, contribute equally to its intrigue for me.</p>

      <h3>The YADG Game</h3>
      <img src="./images/yadgScreen.png">
      <p>One of the most exciting games ever released on the web, the YADG Game is a sports gambling simulator. The goal of the game is to grow your wealth from $50,000 to one million dollars by placing bets on different games. Every virtual "day" there are ten games to bet on. Each game has betting odds for each team, as well as your scouting team's prediction for each team's likelihood to win.
